# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Not that much honestly, I have begun to watch some videos but only when I get confused on a topic because the pracs
are pretty stepped out

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

it would be better to start earlier than the weekend the pracs are due and possibly just watching the videos to watch them
and not when I get lost in the pracs

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Completing the pracs on time which will be difficult as i go away for two weeks

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

putting all the work to the bottom priority of my study like watching the videos and doing the pracs early

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I'm doing an engineering degree currently but I would make the pracs with less step through but with hints to the pracs 
like saying "using the method found in the lecture recording" because currently you can just guess what needs to be done 
by the walkthrough example.
