# CP1404 Practicals

This repo was created by Lachlan Fern an engineering student a JCU and contains the
practical work for CP1404

3 Main lessons I've learned of clean code are:
- Using docstrings in functions to help understanding
- DRY not repeating yourself and getting rid of redundant code
- SRP creating functions with only one responsibility

Other methods of clean code can be found in [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns)

The instructions to each prac are found [here](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals)
