#On line 1 the smallest number that could be seen is 5 and the largest is 20
#On line 2 the smallest number that could be seen is 3 and the largest is 9 and 4 is not possible because it steps by 2 starting at 3
#On line 3 the smallest number that could be seen is around 2.5 and 5.5 as I got 2.5114475713563063 which could be rounded to 2.5, and I assume same for 5.5
